## 😓 My Struggles Behind the Scenes

> 💬 _"The road wasn’t easy. I remember staring at the screen for hours trying to figure out why my loop wasn’t ending, or why the output didn’t match the sample..."_

- Faced repeated **logical errors** in nested conditions.
- Took time to understand **pattern problems** and **loop boundaries**.
- Spent countless nights debugging tiny mistakes like missing `;` or incorrect conditions.
- Failed many test cases before learning **edge-case analysis**.
- Almost gave up, but pushed forward through **trial and error**.
